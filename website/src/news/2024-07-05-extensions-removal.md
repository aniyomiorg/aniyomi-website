# Extensions list removed

**Dear Aniyomi Community,**

Due to extenuating circumstances, we have had to purge our list of extensions.

As of now, **Aniyomi** is transitioning to a fully bring-your-own-content model. What this means is that you can still enjoy **Aniyomi** for manga reading and anime watching, but you'll need to source and add your own content.

We strongly encourage all users to exercise caution, and avoid utilizing extensions from unknown repositories, as they may contain malware.

It's important to note that while existing extensions may continue to work, we cannot guarantee their functionality indefinitely.

Additionally, please be aware that neither our Discord server nor our GitHub repository's issues page will provide support for unofficial extensions.

Best regards,

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
*The Aniyomi Team*
