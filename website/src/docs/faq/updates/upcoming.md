Frequently Asked Questions about Upcoming Updates

## What is this Calendar?
The Upcoming Updates page does *not* consult with external trackers, publishers, or otherwise claim that a chapter/episode update will be released on a particular day.

What it does do is allow users of Aniyomi to visually plot their upcoming smart updates, as well as get a feel for when new chapters/episodes are *expected* to be released.

## What are Smart Updates?
In order to reduce strain on sources and save user bandwidth, Aniyomi tries to estimate when chapter/episode updates will be available, and only once that time has passed, include that series in automatic updates.

## Why are my chapter/episode updates on the wrong day?
Smart updates determine time of chapter/episode updates based on the time between currently released chapters. Sources that provide incorrect update dates, periods of hiatus, or update in batches may result in the estimate seeming off. As more chapters/episodes are released, the schedule should become more accurate.
