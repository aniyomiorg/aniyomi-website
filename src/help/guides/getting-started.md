:::: guide Trouble finding a specific anime/manga
Check your spelling and try again, there's also the chance that your used source may not host the anime/manga you're looking for.
* Some sources use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > For example **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.
* Some sources use different spellings.
  > For example **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**.
* Some sources use different wordings
  > For example **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.
